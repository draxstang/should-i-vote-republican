        Even if you are a billionaire, you're only useful to fascist leaders until you're not. Then you'll be "<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-russians-fall-windows-putin-ukraine-war-1781790" target="_blank">falling out a window</a>", like all of the former allies of Putin.<br />
        But hey, you've got a private jet. Maybe you'll make a clean escape before things kick off. It'll probably still get shot down.`,

        Ever since president <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagan_tax_cuts" target="_blank">Reagan</a>, Republicans have been giving the richest <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/10/opinion/elon-musk-propublica-taxes.html" target="_blank">people</a> and <a href="https://www.marketingscoop.com/consumer/does-amazon-pay-taxes/" target="_blank">corporations</a> tax breaks and making the rest of us pay more. If you give Trump <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/trumps-quid-pro-quo-2669158958" target="_blank">$1 billion</a>, he'll do whatever you want. If you can't, he doesn't care about you.`

I (the creator of this) recently found out that I'm 1/32 Cherokee (a big surprise). The moment you are inconvenient, this will be an excuse to discriminate against you.`,

All while allowing executives to take more and more of the wealth that you create. They don't want you to retire, they want you to die at your job.`,

        n: `You don't have any, <i>yet</i>. All it takes is one bad driver or one company poisoning your environment to give you health problems for life.

They want to tell you that this is a "Christian nation", even though the US constitution <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" target="_blank">explicitly says it's not</a>. And they sure don't sem to follow the new testament's teachings. Republicans want to force an agenda and use religion as a tool without actually following it.`,

Republicans love to say this is a "<a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/04/how-republicans-recast-christian-indoctrination-as-religious-freedom.html" target="_blank">Christian nation</a>", but never seem to identify which specific group of Christians they're talking about. There are 12 different main denominations, and each of those has several sub-groups, each with different ideas and rules. Don't doubt for a second there won't be a series of battles to decide the real winner after all of us "non-believers" are wiped out.`

    <h2>About this thing</h2>
    <p>
      This is meant to be a small art piece to help illustrate that <strong>nobody should ever vote for a Republican</strong>. 
      The Republican party is one of fascism and has been for decades. But they constantly lie and trick people into thinking they have your back.
    </p>
    <p>
      If anything on this page upsets you, I hope it's because you realize you've been fooled by Republicans. But that's ok, you are allowed to learn, change, and be angry at them. 
      If you feel violent urges towards me because of the words here, you are part of the problem and should seek help.
